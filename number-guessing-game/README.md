# ðŸ’» Project : Number Guessing Game
A number guessing game running in the terminal and saving user informations (username, games played, best score). 

## Steps
For this project, you will use Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information.

To complete this project, you need to write a script that generates a random number between 1 and 1000 for users to guess.
Create a `number_guess` database to hold the information suggested in the user stories.

Your script should only ask for input from the user to get the username and to take guesses. Your script should output exactly what is described in the user storied below, and nothing extra.

## Task list
- [x] Create a number_guessing_game folder in the project folder for your program

- [x] Create number_guess.sh in your number_guessing_game folder and give it executable permissions

- [x] Your script should have a shebang at the top of the file that uses #!/bin/bash

- [x] Turn the number_guessing_game folder into a git repository

- [x] Your git repository should have at least five commits

- [x] Your script should randomly generate a number that users have to guess

- [x] When you run your script, you should prompt the user for a username with Enter your username:, and take a username as input. Your database should allow usernames that are 22 characters

- [x] If that username has been used before, it should print Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses., with <username> being a users name from the database, <games_played> being the total number of games that user has played, and <best_game> being the fewest number of guesses it took that user to win the game

- [x] If the username has not been used before, you should print Welcome, <username>! It looks like this is your first time here.

- [x] The next line printed should be Guess the secret number between 1 and 1000: and input from the user should be read

- [x] Until they guess the secret number, it should print It's lower than that, guess again: if the previous input was higher than the secret number, and It's higher than that, guess again: if the previous input was lower than the secret number. Asking for input each time until they input the secret number.

- [x] If anything other than an integer is input as a guess, it should print That is not an integer, guess again:

- [x] When the secret number is guessed, your script should print You guessed it in <number_of_guesses> tries. The secret number was <secret_number>. Nice job! and finish running

- [x] The message for the first commit should be Initial commit

- [x] The rest of the commit messages should start with fix:, feat:, refactor:, chore:, or test:

- [x] You should finish your project while on the main branch, your working tree should be clean, and you should not have any uncommitted changes
